**Biography of the Organizers**


Han Huang (Senior Member, IEEE) received the B.Man. degree in information management and information system from the School of Mathematics, South China University of Technology (SCUT), Guangzhou, China, in 2003, and the Ph.D. degree in computer science from SCUT in 2008. He is currently a full professor and doctoral supervisor of the School of Software Engineering at South China University of Technology. He is currently serving as an associate editor of IEEE Transactions on Evolutionary Computation (IF: 16.497), Complex & Intelligent Systems (IF: 5.8) and IEEE Transactions on Emerging Topics in Computational Intelligence (IF: 5.3), and Director of Teaching Steering Committee for Software Engineering of Undergraduate Colleges and Universities in Guangdong Province. Prof. Huang has made great contributions to the scholarship on the theories and application of intelligent optimization algorithms. For example, he has proposed a time complexity analysis method of real-world evolutionary algorithms, algorithms for efficient and accurate image matting, a method for automated test case generation based on path coverage, etc. Prof. Huang has hosted more than twenty national and provincial projects. He has published two books, Theory and Practice of Intelligent algorithm and Theory, Methods and Tools for Time Complexity Analysis of Evolutionary Algorithm. He has also published more than 80 papers in IEEE TCYB, IEEE TETC, IEEE TSE, IEEE TEVC, IEEE TIP, IEEE TFS, and Science China, including ESI highly cited papers. As the first inventor, Prof. Huang has 41 invention patents granted in China and seven invention patents granted in the United States. He won China Patent Excellence Award and developed an association standard entitled “Standard for glass-box testing without source code” as the first completer. Additionally, Prof. Huang pays attention to social services. Over the past five years, he has given more than 50 public lectures on science and technology for government offices, primary and secondary schools, CCF, YOCSEF.

Xueming Yan received the Ph.D. degree in computer science from the South China University of Technology, Guangzhou, China, in 2018.She was a visiting scholar at the University of Surrey in the UK, and a postdoctoral researcher at the Bielefeld University in Germany.
