**Aim and Scope**

The special session focuses on the emerging field of machine learning assisted heuristics for combinatorialoptimization. It aims to bring together researchers from various disciplines to explore novel theories, algorithms, and applications in combinatorial optimization. As optimization plays an increasingly important role in science and engineering, this special session will provide a platform for experts from both academia and industry to discuss promises and challenges in solving combinatorial optimization problems using machine learning techniques and heuristics algorithms.

Combinatorial optimization is a branch of mathematics and computer science that deals with the efficient arrangement or selection of elements from a finite set. The target of combinatorial optimization problems (COPs) is to find the optimal combination or arrangement of elements, subject to specific constraints and criteria. The complexity and difficulty of solving COPs often arise from the combinatorial structure of the problem, where the interactions between different elements contribute to the overall optimization challenge. There is a wide range of applications of combinatorial optimization in real-world scenarios, such as optimizing routes for delivery trucks, scheduling tasks in manufacturing, the fine-tuning of telecommunication networks and managing financial portfolios. However, solving such NP-hard problems is non-trivial due to the huge search space of feasible solutions as well as the complexity arising from combinatorial structures. As the scale of the problem grows, finding an optimal solution becomes increasingly difficult for COPs. Furthermore, the dynamic nature of real-world environments demands adaptive optimization strategies, and trade-offs between conflicting objectives may further increase the difficulty of the optimisation process. While combinatorial optimization serves as a powerful tool for addressing real-world tasks, it becomes more and more essential to develop efficient algorithms to overcome the inherent difficulties of COPs. 

Heuristics and meta-heuristics methods, such as, Tabu-based methods, swarm intelligence algorithms, genetic algorithms,  have been successfully applied to various types of COPs since the last century. However, these methods suffer from huge computational complexity as they tackle large-scale COPs from scratch and need tailored designs for each specific COP, leading to a lack of efficiencies and generalizability. The recent advances of machine learning and success of pre-trained models, for example, large language models, inspire us to enpower and revitalize the area of using (meta-)heuristics for solving combinatorial optimization problems. Additionally, graph representation learning has emerged as a promising paradigm for solving COPs, since most COPs can be described as graph-structured data. Graph representation learning can not only handle the inherent complexity of COPs but also learn powerful information embedded in graph representations. However, research on solving COPs by heuristics with the help of machine learning techniques is still in its early stages. Therefore, we propose a special issue here to encourage researchers to focus on and contribute to the area of Machine Learning assisted Heuristics for Combinatorial Optimization.
